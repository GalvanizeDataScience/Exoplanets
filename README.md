# Exoplanets
Using NASA data to determine if observation indicates that an exoplanet was located

Discovering exoplanets is approached with several techniques:
  
  Astrometry	(1) - star wobbles compared to neatrby starts
  
  Disk Kinematics	(1) - looking for gaps in material around star (where it collected into an object
 
  Eclipse Timing Variations	(16) - a binary star system where eclipsing has variation due to other object(s)
 
  Imaging	(50) - removing the star's light from the image to find what remains

Microlensing	(96) - light from the star is gravitationally bent

Orbital Brightness Modulation	(6) - the brightness of the star changes because of reflected light 

Pulsar Timing	(7) - slight regular variation in pulsar bursts due to other objects

Pulsation Timing Variations	(2) - Doppler shift in bursts from a pulsar

Radial Velocity	(810) - star's motion displays a wobble

Transit	(3191) - an object block some of the star's light

Transit Timing Variations	(21) - measuring variations in the transit times to detect other objects
