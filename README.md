# Exoplanets
Using NASA data to determine if observation indicates that an exoplanet was located

Discovering exoplanets is approached with several techniques:
 
Astrometry	(1) - star wobbles compared to nearby stars  
Disk Kinematics	(1) - looking for gaps in material around star (where it collected into an object  
Eclipse Timing Variations	(16) - a binary star system where eclipsing has variation due to other object(s)  
Imaging	(50) - removing the star's light from the image to find what remains  
Microlensing	(96) - light from the star is gravitationally bent  
Orbital Brightness Modulation	(6) - the brightness of the star changes because of reflected light  
Pulsar Timing	(7) - slight regular variation in pulsar bursts due to other objects  
Pulsation Timing Variations	(2) - Doppler shift in bursts from a pulsar  
Radial Velocity	(810) - star's motion displays a wobble  
Transit	(3191) - an object block some of the star's light  
Transit Timing Variations	(21) - measuring variations in the transit times to detect other objects
